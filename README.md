# phylogeny-of-charinidae-scripts
Here are some of the scripts used to analyse data and plot figures for the paper 'Phylogeny and biogeography of the pantropical whip spider family Charinidae (Arachnida, Amblypygi)'.

"sequence_statistics.R" is a script to get sequence aligment statistics; "change_names.pl" contain codes to quickly change tip names in a phylogenetic tree (any format) using the terminal.

TNT scripts and morphological matrix can be found in Morphobank Project 3538 (morphobank.org).
